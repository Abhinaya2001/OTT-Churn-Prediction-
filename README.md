# OTT-Churn-Prediction-
PROBLEM DEFINITION
 In the highly competitive world of OTT (Over-the-Top) streaming platforms, subscriber
 churn– the rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions– is a major financial
 hurdle. OTT platforms strive to retain users by offering compelling content libraries, but
 with so many services vying for attention, subscribers can easily switch providers.
 Predicting churn is crucial for developing targeted retention strategies. This involves
 analyzing user data, such as demographics, viewing habits, content preferences, and
 engagement levels, to identify factors that increase the likelihood of churn. By building
 churn prediction models, OTT platforms can proactively intervene with at-risk
 subscribers, potentially through personalized recommendations, targeted promotions, or
 improved user experience initiatives. This not only reduces customer churn but also
 allows for more efficient resource allocation and content development, ultimately leading
 to a sustainable and profitable business model for the OTT platform.

Algorithms used
1.Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forestclassifier
4. Graident Boosting Classifier
5. KNN Classification
6. Naive Bayes
 
<b> Conclusion </b>
 The analysis of various machine learning algorithms for churn prediction on OTT
 platforms indicates that the Gradient Boosting Classifier is the most effective model with
 the highest accuracy score of 89.66%. This demonstrates its ability to capture complex
 patterns and interactions in the data, making it the best choice among the evaluated
 models for predicting customer churn.
 The Random Forest Classifier also performs well, achieving an accuracy score of
 89.17%, closely following the Gradient Boosting Classifier. Other models such as KNN
 Classification (87.67%), Decision Tree (86.67%), and Logistic Regression (86.17%)
 show competitive performance. The Naive Bayes classifier, with an accuracy of 85.0%,
 has the lowest accuracy among the models but still provides useful insights
